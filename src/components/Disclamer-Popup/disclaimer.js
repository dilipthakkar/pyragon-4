            you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of
            experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could
            sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and
            therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to
            lose. ICO's, IEO's, STOâ€™s and any other form of offering will not
            guarantee a return on your investment.
